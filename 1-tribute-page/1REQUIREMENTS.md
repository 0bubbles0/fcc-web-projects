## 1. Tribute Page
### TOOLS
* You can use **HTML, JavaScript, and CSS** to complete this project.
* Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS.
* You **can use Bootstrap or SASS** if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1777</strong> - Born in Brunswick, Germany to working-class, illiterate parents. Gauss later figures
          out his exact date of birth - 2 Wednesdays before Ascension, i.e. 30th April - himself.</li>
        <li><strong>Early childhood</strong> - Gauss is a mathematical prodigy even as a toddler.</li>
        <li><strong>1784-1785</strong> - Aged 7, Gauss solves the arithmetic series "<var>1+2+…+99+100</var>" as the
          fastest pupil in
          his class.</li>
        <li><strong>1792-1795</strong> - He enters the Collegium Carolinum in Brunswick with a stipend from the Duke of
          Brunswick.</li>
        <li><strong>1795-1799</strong> - Gauss studies at the Universities in Göttingen and in Brunswick. He makes great
          advances in the discipline of Number Theory, especially with problems around constructing polygons (he
          achieved the 17-gon), Prime Numbers, Quadratic Equations and Polynomials.</li>
        <li><strong>1798</strong> - Completes his magnum opus "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae", which is published in 1801
          and proves the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra on the root of a Polynomial.</li>
        <li><strong>1805</strong> - Marries his first wife Johanna Osthoff. They have three children until her death in
          1809, which Gauss mourns for the rest of his life.</li>
        <li><strong>1807</strong> - Gauss becomes director of the Göttingen observatory and turns his attention to the
          field of Astronomy. His second book Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum
          on the estimation of planetary orbits also examines differential equations and several fundamental concepts of
          Statistics, such as the Normal Distribution, Least Squares and Maximum Probability.</li>
        <li><strong>1810</strong> - Marries Minna Waldeck. They have a further three children until hear death in 1831.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1818</strong> - Invents the heliotrope while conducting an astronomical survey in Hanover.</li>
        <li><strong>Adult life</strong> - Gauss constantly works on mathematical problems and makes many ground-breaking
          discoveries, often publishing them decades later. In Algebra, he works on Fermat theorems, date calculators
          and algorithms. He is also interested in non-Euclidean Geometry. Due to his dislike of teaching, he never
          becomes professor at a university.</li>
        <li><strong>1832 - 1840</strong> - Working with Wilhelm Weber, Gauss turns his eye to the field of Physics and
          progresses theories on earth magnetism and gravity. They build a telegraph for their private entertainment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1840</strong> - "Dioptrische Untersuchungen" is published on optical systems. Gauss Learns Russian
          as a hobby.</li>
        <li><strong>1855</strong> - Dies of a heart attack aged 77 in Göttingen, Germany.</li>
      </ul>
